Task Management Board.A simple and interactive task management board built with React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and Flask (Python). It allows users to manage their tasks visually using drag-and-drop across multiple status columns — To Do, In Progress, and Done.
Features:
📝 Create, edit, and delete tasks

🔄 Drag-and-drop tasks between columns

⚡ Real-time UI updates with persistent backend sync

🎨 Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

📦 RESTful API with Python Flask backend

The board is divided into three main columns:

To Do – Tasks yet to be started

In Progress – Tasks currently being worked on

Done – Completed tasks

Each task can be dragged across columns, and users can create or delete tasks with a click.
